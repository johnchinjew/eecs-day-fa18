Before the first run on each machine, run ./install to install iPython and dependencies.

This lab is configured to run in a temporary state. To start the lab, simply run
the command:

./runLab

from this directory. This will automatically create a temp directory, copy the files,
and start the iPython Notebook in a web browser.

To end the lab, terminate the iPython session from the command line (Ctrl-C, then y,
then enter), then close the browser tab with the notebook. All of the temporary files
will be cleaned up automatically.

Repeat ./runLab as necessary for each lab session...

If, on the other hand, you'd like to save the lab state (if the lab is being run
on a student's personal laptop, for example) you can just run:

jupyter notebook EECS_Day_CS_Lab.ipynb

and the lab will save as normal.
